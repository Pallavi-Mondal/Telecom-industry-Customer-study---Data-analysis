It's always wonderful to see services customized to your needs.  
Businesses try to understand your behavior and adjust their offerings  
so as to ensure you feel attached to their services.

  
**InsaidTelecom**, one of the leading telecom players, understands that customizing offering  
is very important for its business to stay competitive.  
Currently, InsaidTelecom is seeking to leverage behavioral data from more than 60% of the 50 million mobile devices active daily in India  
to help its clients better understand and interact with their audiences.

In this  **consulting assignment**, Insaidians are expected to build a dashboard to understand  
user's demographic characteristics based on their mobile usage, geolocation, and mobile device properties.  
Doing so will help millions of developers and brand advertisers around the world pursue  
data-driven marketing efforts which are relevant to their users and catered to their preferences.
